A man is on a trip with a fox, a goose, and a sack of corn. 
He comes upon a stream which he has to cross, and finds a tiny boat which 
he can use for the same. The problem though, is that he can only take 
himself and either the fox, the goose, or the corn across at a time. 
It is not possible for him to leave the fox alone with the goose or the 
goose alone with the corn. How can he get all safely over the stream?
